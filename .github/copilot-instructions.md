This is a React.js and TypeScript chat UI application. When working on this project:

1. **Use TypeScript** for all components and maintain strict type safety
2. **Follow React best practices** including proper component structure and hooks usage
3. **Use modern CSS** with CSS modules or styled components for styling
4. **Implement responsive design** that works on both desktop and mobile
5. **Focus on accessibility** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
6. **Use semantic HTML** for better structure and accessibility
7. **Implement proper error boundaries** and loading states
8. **Use React hooks** like useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo appropriately
9. **Keep components small and focused** on single responsibilities
10. **Use proper TypeScript interfaces** for props, state, and data structures

## Project Structure
- Components should be organized in logical folders
- Use proper naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Keep types in separate files when they become complex
- Use proper import/export statements
